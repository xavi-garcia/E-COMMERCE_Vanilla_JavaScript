# Manga E-Commerce

This is a vanilla JavaScript e-commerce. Bootstrap was used to boost CSS styles. It is an asynchronous code that uses fetch to retrieve data from a JSON file. Toastify and SweetAlert are in charge of delivering the alerts.

On this app, you can find mangas (Japanese comic books) and add them to the cart. For a more personalized experience, you can filter products by different categories and even search your mangas by the author's name. Finally, you can increase or decrease the product quantity in the cart. If you have products in the cart, you can continue with the purchase and complete the form. All input fields must be completed in order to end the purchase. Once the form is completed, you will receive a personalized alert with the order id.
The products purchased will be stored in the local store.
